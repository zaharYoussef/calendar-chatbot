# Calendar Chatbot

This project is a chatbot designed to interact with Google Calendar, helping users manage busy schedules. Instead of manually searching through the calendar, users can ask the bot to create events or get event details. The bot uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini for communication and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers.
